**Task - Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars by analyzing key vehicle attributes and applying a machine learning regression model.

**Dataset**: Used car dataset

**Key features:**
1. Present price
2. Driven kilometers
3. Fuel type
4. Transmission
5. Number of owners
6. Car age
